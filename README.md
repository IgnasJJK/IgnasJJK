### Hi, I'm Ignas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer programmer, currently working in digital content QA. I'm passionate about gaming and hope to make games in the future.

I mainly use C++ for my major projects, C# for work, and Python for quick prototypes or automations.
Trying out Dart (with Flutter) for Android applications. 

**Working on:** [an 8086 disassembler](https://github.com/IgnasJJK/disassembler) and a video game.

**Learning:** maths, 3D modeling, computer architecture, performance, among lots of other things.
